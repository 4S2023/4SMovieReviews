	<h1>Comedy Movies Reviews</h1>
	<p>Comedy is a movie genre in which the goal of the movies in this genre is to make the viewers laugh. Comedy movies are light-hearted dramas that strives to make viewers laugh and enjoy themselves. The situations, languages, actions, and the characters are all exaggerated drastically. Comedy captures the flaws, quirks, and annoyances of life and offers amusement and relief from the mundane. Comedy movies usually lead to happy endings, but the humour occasionally have a dark or gloomy side. The two main types of comedies are comedian-led comedies by which jokes and gags are strategically planned and situation comedies that are conveyed as a part of a narrative. Both comedic elements may coexist or overlap.</p>
