	<h1>Horror Movies Reviews</h1>
	<p>Horror is a movie genre in which the goal of the movies in this genre is to thrill, shock, and frighten its viewers. Horror usually features a main antagonist, monster, or menace that often reflects the fear that the society at the time was experiencing. The phrase "other" is usually used for the antagonists because they are different and unknown to the society and therefore, is feared by the society. This is also one of the factors in the evolution of the horror genre over time. Horror evolves along with culture and phobias. The music used in the movies is also a key component in the horror genre as it can effectively be used to create tension and the atmosphere of a horror movie.</p>
